Insurgent Games
---------------

Insurgent Games was founded in 2009 by Micah Lee and Crystal Mayer out of their San Francisco studio apartment. For a couple of years they made iPhone and Android games while doing other work on the side. They quickly realized that unless you're incredibly lucky, it's hard to make enough money doing indie mobile game development to pay San Francisco rent, and so Micah got a full time job and Crystal moved on to other things.

Now, several years later, Micah works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation defending internet users from evil (https://www.eff.org/files/xkcd_comic.png), and Crystal is a freelance web designer (http://moonsprocket.com/). But Insurgent Games is dormant.

Since we're not working on the games anymore, we decided to release them to the community where maybe they can thrive and be reborn as bigger and better things. All of our games are licensed under the GNU General Public License.
